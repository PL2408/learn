listened to Vitaly's first lecture on networks
about the types of cables used: coaxial, twisted pair, fiber. Initially, a LAN was created, which was connected using a HUB device. It sent data evenly to all computers on the network, and this was the first level of data transfer. he was replaced by a SWICH device that recognized data packets and sent them to the desired MAC address. then an IP protocol was created that works with a router and is essentially a global network. protocols ipv4, ipv6 and signal transmission by cables were considered. more details in the written synopsis.

youtobe vieos about networks
1. 
NAT [Network Address Translation] with PAT many devices can go online with the same address
2. 
DNS servers. Resolver. what is it for, how does it recognize sites, what requests does it send?
3. 
LAN-WAN, denotes networks depending on the scale and type of organization. LAN [Local Area Network] - local area network. WAN [Wide Area Network] is a global network. LAN - ethernet standart. WAN - HDLC, PPP [Point-to-Point Protocol] standarts
4. 
The OSI seven-tier model is a transfer process
 data, which was divided into 7 parts.
- physical signal transmission [Ethernet]
- channel [frame] data information
- network: routing and IP. We send a DNS request and receive the answer in the form of the IP address and we substitute it in a package. Data encapsulation is the process of transferring data from the upper levels to the lower ones. Decapsulation is the opposite. Layer routing and protocols: RiP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP.
- at the fourth level secure data transmission by TCP, UPD protocols is carried out. TCP [Transmission Control Protocol] - loss-sensitive traffic. Provides control over data transfer. UPD [User Datagram Protocol]. Network engineers use the first four levels, the other three are used mainly by developers.
5. 
VPN [Virtual Private Network] enables a virtual connection to the network for remote access. Connection types:
- site-to-site
- remote access
A tunnel is built through the router to the same equipment in another location.
When building a tunnel from an individual device to the desired A tunnel is built through the router to the same equipment in another location VPN server, the IP address will be changed. All information transmitted through the VPN gateway is encrypted with an encryption algorithm. Algorithms are divided into symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric ones use the same key for both encryption and decryption. Example: AES [Advanced Encruption Standart]
Asymmetric uses two different keys, open for encryption and closed for decryption. PCA is an example of such encryption. Algorithms may or may not be crypto-resistant. A non-cryptoproof example: DES [Data Encription Standart] the key length of which is 56 bits, crypto-resistant 256 bit.
6.
Ethernet - a family of packet data transmission technologies of the 802.3 group. It is used to build LAN local networks. In the OSІ, it is on the first two levels. The most popular cable for connecting Ethernet UTP 5 [Unshielded Twisted Pair]
7.
TelNet [Teletype Network]
with its help, you can remotely connect to a network device and manage it. By default, telnet uses TSP port 23. When connecting to telnet, you can use text commands to set server commands, run programs, create and delete files and directories, and manage network parameters. All passwords and logins are transmitted in open form.
SSH [Secure shell] built for secure remote access and listens carefully TCP. All commands will be encrypted with a unique key. To connect remotely, the device must act as a TelNet/SSH server and must be the TelNet/SSH client with which the connection is initiated. For this, you need a program that acts as a terminal emulator: for example PUTTY.
8.
FireWall - an active network device responsible for infrastructure security. It works on the third level of the OSI model. Protects the global network from unauthorized access from external untrusted networks. It works by passing and receiving only safe files, using ACL [Access Control List] access control lists. Two tipes of FireWall:
- Statefull
- Stateless
Host-Based FireWall- software.
9.
DevOps - Development and Operations
a model of interaction between those who write code and those who make this code work, roll it out into production, manage servers. Such a profession is called a DevOps engineer. Basic things that a DevOps engineer should know:
- easy to navigate in Windows and Linux
- to know network technologies at the level of CISCO CCNA
- know tools for configuration management and server automation: CHEF, PUPPET, ANSIBLE
- to be able to write scripts in Python
additionally:
- continuous integration and delivery [CI/CD] assembly and testing of the final product
- about distributed version control
- containerization and orchestration
- infrastructure management as a code
- virtualization
10. HTTP/ HTTPS
HTTP [Hypertext Transfer Protocol] transmits hypertext with hyperlinks, which represent a path to another file on the Internet, that is, its URL. He does this using the TCP session on port 80. The image page is written in the markup language HTML [Hypertext Markup Language] 
HTTP it is a client-server protocol
you can also get to the page knowing its URL [Uniform Resource Locator]
HTTP consists of:
- start page (contains URL and request method)
There are methods GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE
The start page of the response from the server is different from the request. It transmits a three-digit processing status code. There are 5 types in total:
-1.. information about the data transfer process
-2..info about successful transfer
-3..redirection
-4.. client error
-5..the server is not working
- Header: contains information about logins, language, authorization and so on
- Message body:
These are data that we send in a request or receive in a response from the server
HTTP transmits all data in open form. That's why the extension appeared HTTPS [Secure] encrypts all data. Encryption is provided by SSL and TLS mechanisms
SSl [Secure Sockets Layer] works when we connect to a site and ask the site to identify itself. In response, the site will send us a copy of its SSL certificate, adding that it is secure.
TLS [Transport Layer Security] is a newer version SSL
10.
MAC [Media Access Control] it is the physical address of the device, has a unique combination of numbers and letters 48 bits long. Is the hardware number of the equipment, which is assigned to it at the factory. The first 6 digits of the МАС mean productivity, that is, OUI
[Organizational Unique Identifier]
the other 6 are unique and identify the NIC of the network card
[Network Interface Controller]
