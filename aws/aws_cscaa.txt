Video 1:
cloud computing and certification 
aws provides its customers with access to services: data storage, computing power
the tipe of cloud computing - public cloud, privat cloud, hybrid cloud
The company has phisical servers, but  to increase data storage we can use AWS servises, like S3 [a large repository for deleting any amount of data from anywhere],ec2 [Elastic Computing Cloud]
Video 2:
programs can be scaled by automatic scaling and elastic balancing
areas of study:
one of the first exams is a specialist in cloud technology
three areas of specialization: certified deacision architect, DevOps engineer, DevOps administrator
Video 3: admission criteria
Practical experience of using computer network storage is required
the course provides an opportunity to learn how to use services S3 [a large repository for deleting any amount of data from anywhere], ec2 [Elastic Computing Cloud], as well as part of a database
practical experience in deploying and managing services AWS, as well as understanding the global infrastructure
abbreviation of the specialty: SAA-C01 [assistant architect]
cost $ 150, 130m 65 questions, passing score 720 out of 1000
Video 4:
practical work on creating an account AWS
acquaintance with the interface, services, budget planning
Video 5:
regions and accessibility zones AWS
these are the geographical areas that the SS uses to locate its infrastructure. There are regional and global services. zone 1 is the physical availability of capacity in a particular region (availability zone)
to improve performance, you need to place the specimens in several areas of availability to avoid fault tolerance
if one of the zones is not accessible, the consumer will still have access to the information
Video 6:
Service ec2[Elastic Computing Cloud]
EBS [Elastic Block Store] storage of proprietary blocks for data storage
ELB [Elastic Load Balancing] load balancer
AMI [Amazon Machine Image] provides the information needed to run the instance
tells about the types of instances, the possibility of their creation, the security group
Video 7:
instantiate ec2 using a protocol SSH
practice session

Video 8:
a test that I did not pass
Video 9:
topic: see screen part9 about security group
the topic of private and public IP was considered
told about the elastic IP address by means of which other users can continue connection to the machine even after preliminary disconnection screen [elasticIP part9] and [elasticIP2 part9]
User Data additional user settings that are stored in the instance
AMI [Amazon Machine Image]

Video 10:
Vertical and Horizontal scaling

vertical scaling is an increase in the power of an existing machine

horizontal scaling is the use of additional machines to increase power

such types of balance weights: V2 works through protocols TCP,UPD,TLS

V2 7 works with WEB programs, protocols HTTP, HTTPS

V1base balance weight, stale

balance weights use active and passive checks of nodes

and something about ‘'Listener’' and ‘'Target group’', i didn’t quite understand

and something about ‘'sticky’' didn’t understand also. How to do balance weight sticky?
27.06
created load balanser and ec2, combined machines creating target group. Set up security for accounts, created admin account to aws

EBS [Elastic Blokc storage]data is stored in blocks in storage. each block has its own capacity of 512 GB and its own unique address. Each block can be controlled separately. storage can be local or connected to the network. is formed using file systems fat32 NTFS ext3, ext4.

Video 17
EBS snapshot - backup. Each backup complements the previous one with new data, and does not completely replace it. This saves disk space. Data is not duplicated. EBS depends on availability zones. With an existing snapshot, you can create a new volume or instance and place it in any region. You can change the security group. Create snapshot policy lifecycle - in this section you can make changes to the snapshot. To transfer a snapshot to another availability zone, you need to convert it to a volume. Encryption - encryption of data. The keys are created automatically and it is very convenient. If we have created default encryption on a volume or snapshot, then the instance can be attached only by specifying the encryption support function.
Video 18
EFS - elastic file storage. AV C offers a fully managed EFS file system for use with cloud services and local resources. It can be expanded and reduced depending on needs. Storage classes:
-standard
- with infrequent access
EFS can be managed using security groups and data can be placed in different Availability Zones



EC2 from the scratch
===========================
1. Create VPC
	VPC only
	Name: lp-vpc
	IPv4 CIDR manual input
	CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
	No IPv6 CIDR block
	Tenancy: Default
	Tags: nothing

2. Internet gateway
	Name - lp-igw
	attach to VPC

3. Route table:
	add route: 0.0.0.0 igw-<name>
	choose internet gateway

4.Subnets
add VPC
name .....
avilability zone 'eu-central-1a'
IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24
EC2

5.Create security group
name
Auto-assign public IP  Info enable
Allow SSH traffic from my ip
launche instance
join to security group
check inboundse rules

6.Launch an instance
Name ec2-.....
Application and OS Images 
Instance type t2micro or another type
Key pair (login) p_l.pem

7.EC2 connections
terminal
cd .ssh/
pwd
copy instance and public ip, like ssh -i "p_l.pem" ec2-user@3.121.207.225
yes
done
