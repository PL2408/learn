1. Write "Hello World"
	command:
		print("Hello, World!")
			result: Hello, World


 Variables:

 1. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
	command:
		x = "Lazarenko"
		y = 7
		print(x)
		print(y)
			result: Lazarenko
					7

 2. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
	command:
		x = 4
		x = "Sally"
		x = "Petro"
		print(x)
			result: Petro
 3. If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting
 	command:
 		x = str(7)
		y = int(7)
		z = float(7)
		print(x)
		print(y)
		print(z)
			result: 7
					7
					7.0	

 4. You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
 	command:
 		x = 7
		y = "Petro"
		print(type(x))
		print(type(y))
			result: <class 'int'>
					<class 'str'>
 
 5. String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
 	command:
 		x = "Petro"
		print(x)
		x = 'Petro'
		print(x)
			result: Petro
					Petro

 6. Variable names are case-sensitive.
 	command:
 		a = 7
		A = "Petro"

		print(a)
		print(A)
			result: 7
					Petro
